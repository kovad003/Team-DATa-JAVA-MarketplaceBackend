# Description
The Second Hand Store Application built with React Native and Google App Engine is a mobile app that enables users to browse and purchase second-hand items. The app features user authentication, a search and browse functionality for second-hand items, a shopping cart, and a checkout process. The application is built using React Native, a popular mobile application development framework, and uses a Java RESTful backend to handle data management and processing.

The backend is responsible for exposing a set of RESTful APIs that the frontend uses to interact with the application's database. The backend also handles user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access the application's features.

The application is deployed on Google App Engine, a scalable and reliable cloud platform that provides a seamless and secure user experience. The app leverages Google App Engine's infrastructure to handle high traffic loads and provide high availability, ensuring that the app is always accessible to users.
